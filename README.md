# satellite_tracking_app

IMPORTANT NOTE:
You'll need to replace 'YOUR_API_KEY' with your actual API key
and 'SATELLITE_ID' with the ID of the satellite you want to track.

This is a sample code that you can custom.

# I implemented a search feature that allows users to find specific satellites by name or number.
This could involve adding a search bar in the UI and some logic to filter the list of satellites based on user input.
